# NVIDEA ONLINE COURSE PROJECT
## Sign-Language-MNIST-Dataset-CNN-Data-Augmentation

The original lecture is from NVIDEA's online course - Getting Started with Deep Learning. https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+S-FX-01+V1/about I make some changes on codes and markdown to learn more about Deep Learning.

In this project, I used Sign-Language-MNIST-Dataset to train 3 CNN models. 

Model1 - Using CNN model. The result is well but it has an overfitting issue.
Model2 - Increaseing Dropout rate and Dropout node to solve overfitting issue.
Model3 - Data augmentation to solve overfitting issue.

Results: 
The project shows both 2 methods can solve the overfitting problem. 

Another Jupyter File is the code of how to save the model in your environment and depploy model to predict.

If you want to see more detail description, you can find code and report in the file.
